            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              At Ed-Buddy, we're enhancing early education for kids, parents, and
              teachers. Traditional learning often misses the mark, leaving parents
              without useful resources.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              That's why we created Ed-Buddyâ€”a fun learning platform for kids. Our AI
              assistant provides personalized support and keeps kids motivated with
              animated lessons.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              We create engaging videos and interactive games that make learning
              enjoyable. Through storytelling and kid-friendly graphics, we ensure
              lessons are exciting and easy to understand.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              Our platform uses games and real-world activities to help children develop
              essential skills like teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              Ed-Buddy also features a parent dashboard for tracking progress and
              content management. Teachers, parents, and students can connect easily
              in one place.
            </p>

            <p className="text-text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
              At Ed-Buddy, we're not just teaching subjects; we're fostering curious,
              confident, and future-ready learners.
